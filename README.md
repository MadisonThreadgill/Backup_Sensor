# Backup_Sensor
Sensor similar to one used in a car when backing up. 
Includes an active buzzer, LCD panel, RGB led, and of course an ultrasonic sensor. 

When the object gets closer than 10 cm to the sensor, the led lights up pink and the buzzer is activated.
When the object gets between 10 and 50 cm to the sensor, the led lights up teal.
Finally, when the object gets greater than 50cm from the object, the led lights up a purple/pink color. 
No matter the distance (up to 400cm), the lcd display shows how far away the object is from the sensor.
